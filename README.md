# Integer-Particles

Something to do with simulated particles that have their postions as integers to make collision detection easy

Requires python 3 because I needlessly used the new print syntax.

The actaul physics seems to be prettty innacurate, but it looks nice so it might end up being some kinda game.

10/10 would recommend making cpu bound games in python
